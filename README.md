## Technologies
I used `React.Js`,`MateriaUI`, `MateriaIcons`,`Axios`,`ReactPlayer`, `React-Router-Dom` ...

## Setup
- Download or clone the repository
- Install dependecies : `npm install`
- Run : `npm run dev`
- Build : `npm run build`
- Build Preview : `npm run preview`

## Approach

This application is developed based on the scafolding provided by Vite, which includes rollup, esBuild, ESmodules, etc.

- The design is inspired by the original YouTube with the difference that it is implemented in a dark theme and using a UI library.

- The layout is made with the MaterialUI library using Flexbox and Grid. 

- It has a fully functional player using the ReactPlayer library.

- The Routes are made from React-Router-Dom

- API calls are controlled from the AXIOS library which allows asynchronous calls to apis with a much simpler schema.

## Status
[YouTube MUI ] is still in progress. `Version 1.6.9` will be out soon.
